## Capital Costs

### Fuel Cells
The United States Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy published [Technical Targets for Stationary Fuel Cell Systems](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/doe-technical-targets-fuel-cell-systems-stationary-combined-heat-and-power). This listed the installation cost of combined heat and power fuel cell systems operating on natural gas. We assumed this number to be the capital cost for stationary hydrogen fuel cell systems. 

### Power to Gas
The Hydrogen Program from the [Energy.Gov](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/) published [Cost of Electrolytic Hydrogen Production with Existing Technology](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/20004-cost-electrolytic-hydrogen-production.pdf) in the DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program Record on September 14, 2020. The document contains the current and future capital cost for P2G PEM which is used in our model.

### Hydrogen Storage Tank
The capital cost of Stationary Gaseous Hydrogen Storage Tanks was collected from [DOE Technical Targets for Hydrogen Delivery](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/doe-technical-targets-hydrogen-delivery). The Total Electrical Usage ratio of 51.4 kWh/kg [Ref.](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/19009_h2_production_cost_pem_electrolysis_2019.pdf) was used to calculate the correct units ($/GW).

## Fixed Costs

### Fuel Cells 
The United States Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy published [Technical Targets for Stationary Fuel Cell Systems](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/doe-technical-targets-fuel-cell-systems-stationary-combined-heat-and-power). This listed the Annual maintenance cost equal to 2% of the equipment cost for combined heat and power fuel cell systems operating on natural gas. We assumed this number to be the fixed cost for stationary hydrogen fuel cell systems.

### Power to Gas
The PEM fixed costs are from the [Hydrogen Production Cost From PEM Electrolysis - 2019](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/19009_h2_production_cost_pem_electrolysis_2019.pdf) published in February 3, 2019 in the DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program Record. The 2019 and 2035 fixed cost for Distributed Capacity was collected and is used in our model. The Total Electrical Usage ratio of 51.4 kWh/kg [Ref.](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/19009_h2_production_cost_pem_electrolysis_2019.pdf) was used to calculate the correct units ($/GW).

## Variable Costs

### Power to Gas
The variable cost for PEM was found in [Techno-economic Analysis of PEM Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/08/f18/fcto_2014_electrolytic_h2_wkshp_colella1.pdf) dated February 27, 2014. A conservative value was added to our model following this document and using the Total Electrical Usage ratio of 51.4 kWh/kg [Ref.](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/19009_h2_production_cost_pem_electrolysis_2019.pdf) to attain the correct units ($/PJ).
