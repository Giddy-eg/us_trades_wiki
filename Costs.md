## National Renewable Energy Laboratory
In numerous situations, the capital costs, fixed costs and variable costs were taken from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory [2020 Annual Technology Baseline](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2020/data.php). While this is a United States focused report, it provides lower, mid, and upper cost values for the majority of technologies in our model. Moreover, this dataset was utilized by Jaydev et. Al in [U.S. electricity infrastructure of the future: Generation and transmission pathways through 2050](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261919319543) paper. 

Using the NREL data source provides us with reasonable cost figures in one place. Although they are not Canada specific, thus introducing error, it saves significant data collection time and allows us to move forward with modelling other aspects. Once the model is in a more complete form, this data set can be updated to reflect Canadian Numbers. 

## Capital Cost
The source for capital costs are summarized in the table below.
