## Variance in Data
Researching the operational life of various technologies proved to be difficult as sources often disagreed on appropriate values. For example, the [2017 EIA Annual Energy Outlook Report](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/0554(2017).pdf) which provides our Input Activity Ratios has significantly lower values compared to the [NREL 2020 Annual Technology Baseline](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2020/definitions.php) which provides our costs. 

We have currently implemented the [2017 EIA Annual Energy Outlook Report](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/0554(2017).pdf) operations life values, which are listed as Service Life. Other references collected for this model provided numbers that more closely aligned with the EIA values rather then the NREL values. **ADD EXTRA SOURCES HERE**

Due to the variability in operational life values from reputable sources, it will be good to perform a sensitivity analysis to further understand how the operational life effects renewable investment, emissions, and system cost. 

## Sources
### Energy Information Administration
The following operational life values were taken from the [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/). Specifically, their [Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook 2017 Report](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/0554(2017).pdf) in table 5.3 and 5.6. **Need to double check that this is the correct location. I am not seeing the values in this report right now...**
* Coal
* Natural Gas
* Coal
* Nuclear
* Wind
* Solar
* Biomass
* Oil

### Fuel Cells
The [Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]() released a report for [Technical Targets for Fuel Cell Systems for Stationary Applications](). In this report, the projected 2020 lifetime for a stationary fuel cell is 80,000hrs. We estimate this to be 10years. 

### Power to Gas
**Not seeing where our Power to Gas Operational life is coming from**

## Assumptions 
* The operational life for all technologies is the same for all regions
